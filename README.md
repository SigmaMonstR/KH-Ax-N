# KH-Ax-N
----

Remember when Captain Kirk screamed Khaaaaan!! I got curious about a KH(Ax)N graphic that was shown in a DJ Patil talk today. Basically, using a search engine, produce the frequency distribution of the word 'KHAN' with between 1 and 100 A's. Hence KH(Ax)N. Being a multitasker, I decided to code up a R notebook on it. There's a little interactive graph at the end of the doc showing somewhat exponential decay with each additional 'A'.
